# Retro Board App

This app is designed for use within the retrospective phase of an app's development workflow. Team members will use this board to reflect on what went well and what they need to improve on for next time. Users can create, edit and delete cards, give "thumbs up" or thumbs down" to existing cards, and shift cards to adjacent categories.
